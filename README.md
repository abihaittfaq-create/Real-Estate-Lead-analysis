# Lead Scoring & Intent Recognition System

## Overview

This project implements a Lead Scoring and Intent Recognition module for a real estate platform.

The purpose of this system is to analyze customer inquiries and identify customer intent along with lead priority. It helps in understanding customer requirements and identifying potential leads.

The system identifies the purpose of a customer's inquiry based on keywords.

Supported intents:

## Working Process

1. User uploads the inquiry dataset (`inquiries.json`).
2. The system processes all existing customer inquiries from the dataset.
3. Intent Recognition identifies the customer's requirement.
4. Lead Scoring calculates the priority level of each inquiry.
5. The user can also enter a new custom inquiry manually.
6. The system predicts the intent and lead score for the new user query.
